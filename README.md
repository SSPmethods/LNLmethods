# LNLmethods
This folder contains the MATLAB files with coeficients of the methods appearing in the paper:
Christopher Bresten, Sigal Gottlieb, Zachary James Grant, Daniel Higgs, David I Ketcheson and Adrian Nemeth
Explicit strong stability preserving multistep Runge-Kutta methods
In Math of Comp.

The files are names as follows
'S's'P'pLinear.mat have the coefficients of the  stage=S, linear order=P, nonlinear order=2
'S's'P'pLNL.mat have the coefficients of the  stage=S, linear order=P, nonlinear order=4
'S's'P'p3LNL.mat have the coefficients of the  stage=S, linear order=P, nonlinear order=3
